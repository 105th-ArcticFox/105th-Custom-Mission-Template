The 105th Special Operations Capable unit is a special force comprised of members with widely varying specialties. Currently the 105th is engaged in endeavors to suppress insurgency and terrorism in remote and disparate corners of the globe. We operate on the ground, from sea, and the air in offensive measures to destroy the enemy. Common missions for this unit are disruptions of enemy chain of command, intelligence gathering, reconnaissance,  airborne landings, forward assaults, foot/vehicle patrols, and other general purpose combat missions.<br/><br/>

Teamwork and communication are critical in this unit. You will never have to salute an officer, you will hold no rank, you will obligate no time. However, you're welcome to stay if you can follow the leader without hesitation and respect the rules of the unit."]];
