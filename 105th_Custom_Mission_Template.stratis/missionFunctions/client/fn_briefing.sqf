Terrain: The AO is centered around a hill with a ridge line running north-south throughout the AO. The AO is primarily covered in dense jungle. There are three identified trails in AO moving East, North and West out of the objective. Additionally, a secondary road runs North to south along the eastern boundary of the objective.<br/><br/>
Enemy Forces: A reconnaissance patrol has identified a Tanoa Liberation Army (TLA) camp in the jungle north of Kotomo. This camp is believed to be used to stockpile weapons and explosives for insurgent forces in the area. The camp's strength has been estimated between 15 and 20 TLA fighters. 2-4 man patrols have been observed patrolling up to 150m from the camp. Enemy forces in the AO have been observed utilizing soviet bloc type small arms (AKM, RPK, PKM, etc.). TLA forces are known to not have night vision capability. No other enemy forces are known to be operating in the AO.<br/><br/>
No civilians are expected in the AO.<br/><br/>

The 105th Special Operations Capable unit is a special force comprised of members with widely varying specialties. Currently the 105th is engaged in endeavors to suppress insurgency and terrorism in remote and disparate corners of the globe.

Common missions for this unit are disruptions of enemy chain of command, intelligence gathering, reconnaissance,  airborne landings, forward assaults, foot/vehicle patrols, and other general purpose combat missions.<br/><br/>

Teamwork and communication are critical in this unit. You will never have to salute an officer, you will hold no rank, you will obligate no time. However, you're welcome to stay if you can follow the leader without hesitation and respect the rules of the unit."]];
