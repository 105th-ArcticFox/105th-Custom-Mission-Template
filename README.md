# Opening the Template In the Editor Instructions

   1. unzip the template into your profile's mpmissions folder (typically in your
   ArmA 3 folder in Documents)

      Note: Typical Folder Path: C:\Users\yourname\Documents\Arma 3 - Other
      Profiles\%7c105th%7c%20ArcticFox\mpmissions

   2. Change the map suffix from .VR to the desired map.

      Note: changing the map suffix vs copying and pasting everything to a new map
      in the editor is the best way to ensure all settings in the mission.smq file
      remains intact.

      Note: map suffixes are generally just the maps name i.e .Altis / .Malden /
      .Kunduz

      Non-Standard Map Suffixes:
      Livonia = .enoch
      Rosche = .WL_Rosche
      Sarahni = .sara
      Anizay = .term_anizay
      Virolahti = .vt7
      Cherno Winter = .Chernarus_Winter
      Cherno Summer = .chernarus_summer

   4. Rename the mission folder from 105th_Custom_Mission_Template folder i.e 105th_co24_My_Mission.
      
   5. Open the template in the Eden editor
      
      Scenario >> Open >> MPMissions >> 105th_co24_My_Mission (or whatever you named it)

   6. Snap all objects to the surface

      1. Go to the map screen by pressing “M”
      2. Zoom out and press “CTRL+A” to highlight all objects and markers
      3. Press and hold Left “ALT” and then while holding Left “ALT” Left Click
      and hold on any object while dragging your mouse down.
